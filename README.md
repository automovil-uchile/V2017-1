# Electromobility

## EL5004 - Taller de Diseño 2018 - Beauchef Proyecta

The following repository holds the documentiation of the work done for the course EL5004. The scope of the work is to develop an electric car from the perspective of power electronics, control, communications and hardware.

## ¿How to use this repository?

If all you want is to access the code to make your own electric car control system, please look at the /code folder. Inside it there are the necessary files to make all happen. Follow the instructions in the next url https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries to install correctly the library. The program is mainly wrote in C++, so you must be in some level familiar with it to modify the codes. The code was tested under the Arduino UNO and DUE boards, but is highly recommended to use the last one, because of the number of I/O connection required. There is a Python early version of the control systems with some signal visualizations, developed to the use with a Raspberry Pi board.

Our first work started at Spring 2017. It was almost bibliography review and design of main electrical systems.
